## Proton pump inhibitor use and effectiveness of pembroilizumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma

This repository contains the R code used for the analysis presented in the research paper "Effectiveness of pembrolizumab in patients with urothelial carcinoma receiving proton pump inhibitors." The study investigates the impact of concurrent proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use on the treatment outcomes of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) treated with pembrolizumab.

### Abstract
The study assessed the association between PPI use and overall survival (OS), immune progression-free survival (iPFS), and objective response in patients with platinum-treated metastatic UC receiving pembrolizumab. The analysis uses inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted multivariable Cox regression models and an IPTW-adjusted multivariable logistic regression model to evaluate outcomes. We found evidence of inferior outcomes in PPI-users compared to non-users, suggesting that PPI use may be associated with reduced effectiveness of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic UC.
